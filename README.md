# django rest framework official tutorial 
After finished reading and practicing with Django for APIs (by William Vincent) I'm planning to do [the official tutorial](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/).

### Goals:
- Better understand drf concepts
- Getting more familiar with using the Documentation (btw here is a nice [trick](https://www.twitter.com/MossabDiae/status/1470148198278828041))
- Getting ready for personal projects

### The official tutorial is currently made from 6 parts :

- [x] 1 - Serialization
- [x] 2 - Requests and responses
- [x] 3 - Class based views
- [x] 4 - Authentication and permissions
- [x] 5 - Relationships and hyperlinked APIs
- [x] 6 - Viewsets and routers

### How I'm planning to do it :

To avoid deleting code (and potentially good comments) I'll create a new Branche for each part.
