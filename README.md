# django rest framework official tutorial 
## Part 4

### Notes:
- In models : you can auto populate fields by modifying the save function , don't forget to call `super().save(*args, **kwargs)` at the end.
- in the UserSerializer we defined snippets field like this:
``` py
class UserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    snippets = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(many=True, queryset=Snippet.objects.all())
    # ...
```
why didn't we add it directly to fields[..,...] as usual ? , according to the tutorial :
> Because 'snippets' is a **reverse relationship** on the User model, it will not be included by default when using the ModelSerializer class, so we needed to add an explicit field for it.

reverse relationship: âœ… `snippets.owner` , but user don't have a snippets field ,yes it can be accessed from `user.snippets_set` (can even aliased to user.snippets using related_name) but still it's not defined inside the user model thus we need to define it in the serializer .
