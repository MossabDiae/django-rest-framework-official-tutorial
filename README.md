# django rest framework official tutorial 
After finished reading and practicing with Django for APIs (by William Vincent) I'm planning to do the official tutorial.

### Goals:
- Better understand drf concepts
- Getting more familiar with using the Documentation (btw here is a nice [trick](https://www.twitter.com/MossabDiae/status/1470148198278828041))
- Getting ready for personal projects

### The official tutorial is currently made from 6 parts :

- [ ] 1 - Serialization
- [ ] 2 - Requests and responses
- [ ] 3 - Class based views
- [ ] 4 - Authentication and permissions
- [ ] 5 - Relationships and hyperlinked APIs
- [ ] 6 - Viewsets and routers

### How I'm planning to do it :

To avoid deleting code (and potentially good comments) I'll create a new Branche for each part.
